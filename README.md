# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of detecting and identifying emotions from spoken language using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). It plays a crucial role in applications such as human-computer interaction, call centers, healthcare, and personalized services. Below is an explanation of the key components involved in a Speech Emotion Recognition project:

# Objective
   
The goal of the project is to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc., from speech data using machine learning or deep learning models.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes audio files labeled with different emotions, such as the RAVDESS or EMO-DB datasets.

# Tools & Technologies

Python
Librosa (for audio processing)
Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras (for model development)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

# Feature Extraction

MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
Chroma feature
Spectral contrast

# Model Architecture

CNN for feature learning and classification.
SVM and Random Forest as alternative classifiers for comparison.

# How to Run
